Welcome to Notifiers documentation!
=====================================

Got an app or service and you want to enable your users to use notifications with their provider of choice? Working on a script and you want to receive notification based on its output? You don't need to implement a solution yourself, or use individual provider libs. A one stop shop for all notification providers with a unified and simple interface.

Click for a list of currently supported :ref:`providers`.
See latest changes in :ref:`changelog`.

Advantages
----------
- Spend your precious time on your own code base, instead of chasing down 3rd party provider APIs. That's what we're here for!
- With a minimal set of well known and stable dependencies (`requests <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`_, `jsonschema <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonschema/2.6.0>`_ and `click <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/click/6.7>`_) you're better off than installing 3rd party SDKs.
- A unified interface means that you already support any new providers that will be added, no more work needed!
- Thorough testing means protection against any breaking API changes. We make sure your code your notifications will always get delivered!

Installation
------------
Via pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install notifiers

Via Dockerhub:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker pull liiight/notifiers


Basic Usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from notifiers import get_notifier
    >>> pushover = get_notifier('pushover')
    >>> pushover.required
    {'required': ['user', 'message', 'token']}
    >>> pushover.notify(user='foo', token='bar', message='test')
    <NotificationResponse,provider=Pushover,status=Success>

From CLI
--------

.. code-block:: console

    $ notifiers pushover notify --user foo --token baz "This is so easy!"

As a logger
-----------

Directly add to your existing stdlib logging:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import logging
    >>> from notifiers.logging import NotificationHandler
    >>> log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    >>> defaults = {
    ...     'token': 'foo',
    ...     'user': 'bar'
    ... }
    >>> hdlr = NotificationHandler('pushover', defaults=defaults)
    >>> hdlr.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
    >>> log.addHandler(hdlr)
    >>> log.error('And just like that, you get notified about all your errors!')
